# image-compression

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that compares the compression size, PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) of a novel Stable Diffusion approach to two other traditional methods, JPG and WebP. The Stable Diffusion-based framework resulted in a 9% increase in compression efficiency, 8% improvement in PSNR, and maintained the same SSIM when compared to the traditional methods.
